This project was completed by Jeremy Kanovsky and Ryan Sheehan (group 14).

We used eyeplayer-js to detect the users faces and detect blinks.
Future plans involve putting this game on the internet to allow multiple
players to play against one another at the same time, and have a high score
leaderboard.
